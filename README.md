### Building & Running

Execute "Build All" (Ctrl+shift+B) by default
In VS, you can use the Search bar to find this option

Navigate to tangram/tangram.cpp and open the file
Select Startup Item (tangram.exe)
Run

The executable will be accessible in TEngine\out\build\x64-Debug\tangram but it must be in the
same directory as the assets folder and glew32.dll.

"Build All", should copy the assets folder into the same directory as the executable, if
it does not, please copy it manually.

### Program

You can resize the window.

You can also move, scale and rotate the tangram using the following inputs:

WASD - move tangram
Scroll Wheel - scale tangram (zoom)
Q and E - rotate tangram
