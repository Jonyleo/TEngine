Execute "Build All" (Ctrl+shift+B) by default

Navigate to tangram/tangram.cpp and open the file
Select Startup Item (tangram.exe)
Run

The executable will be accessible in TEngine\out\build\x64-Debug\tangram but it must be in the
same directory as the assets folder, glew32.dll and assimp-vc143-mtd.dll.

"Build All", should copy the assets folder into the same directory as the executable, if
it does not, please copy it manually.
